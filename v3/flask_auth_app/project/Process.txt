Step 1- 3 complete, website works

Step 4 Html files insertet, website still works

step 5+6 = made DB. Cant use the commmands in the terminal from the guide.

step 7 Trying to connect with DB. There are some issues with the website, it tries to connect to db but states that it can't 
send the data from the signup form into the DB because it claims that the required table dosn't exist
Its also impossible to run the models.py file which is responsbile for creating the DB corretly
